# Hello world project using Truffle

Run ```truffle init``` to create an empty Truffle project.

* Compile with ```truffle compile```.
* Deploy with ```truffle migrate```. 
* Test with ```truffle test```.

Before running the deployment, make sure you have an Ethereum client running (e.g. Ganache).

Tests are based on the **Mocha** framework syntax (you can use **contract** instead of **describe**).
